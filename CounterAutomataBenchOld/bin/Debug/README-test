All benchmarks were run with the following settings:
TIMEOUT: 10 minute
1 times for each regex

Filtered first 4 regexes. 

The filter is set such that it filteres first regular, than from the correct
regexes with counters and at the end monadic from the rest.

test-filtered - passed regular, monadic with counter
test-notSupported - non regular or such that we do not handle them
test-nonMonadic - non monadic
test-noCounters - no counters

4 passed
0 not suppported
0 no counters
0 non monadic
0 simple strings
0 from non monadic are not nested counters

4 in total.
